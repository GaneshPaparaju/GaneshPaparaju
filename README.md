## 🔎 About Me

I’m a graduate student at **Northeastern University (Boston)** with hands-on experience building **end-to-end data and AI systems** — from ingestion and transformation to analytics, visualization, and LLM-powered insight generation.

My interests broadly span:
- **Data engineering & analytics platforms**
- **Applied AI and LLM-based systems**
- **Multi-agent architectures**
- **Clean, scalable system design**

I enjoy working on problems that combine **engineering depth** with **practical impact**, across different domains.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🍽️ MaRGen-Inspired Multi-Agent Market Analysis
**Applied AI | LLM Agents | Streamlit**

- Designed a **multi-agent pipeline** (Retriever → Researcher → Writer → Reviewer)
- Agents collaborate to analyze data, generate insights, and iteratively refine reports
- Built an interactive **Streamlit application** to surface agent reasoning step-by-step
- Inspired by the **MaRGen (2025)** research paper on agent-based market research
