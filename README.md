## 🔎 About Me

I’m a graduate student at **Northeastern University (Boston)** with hands-on experience designing and building **end-to-end data, analytics, and AI systems** — from raw data ingestion and transformations to modeling, visualization, and intelligent insight generation.

My interests and work span:
- **Data engineering & analytics platforms**
- **Dimensional modeling and data visualization**
- **High-performance computing (HPC) & parallelism**
- **Agentic AI and multi-agent LLM systems**
- **Clean, scalable, production-oriented system design**

I enjoy working on problems that require **engineering depth**, **performance awareness**, and **real-world impact**, rather than purely academic prototypes.
